# PaperMC
A cli tool written in bash meant to be used to download papermc files. (This project is free to use for anyone, but credit is nice. MIT LICENSE)

## Requirements
Requires the cli tool `jq` to be installed for the json manipulation.
Requires `curl` to be installed for making the api requests.

## Usage:
```bash

# PaperMC lets you query for versions
./papermc.bash listVersions

# Query for Build numbers
./papermc.bash listBuilds 1.17.1

# Or download a paperclip jar:
./papermc.bash get 1.17.1 latest # Saves the latest build for 1.17.1 into paperclip.jar
./papermc.bash get latest latest # Saves the latest build for the latest minecraft into paperclip.jar
./papermc.bash get 1.17.1 137 > customfile.jar # Saves build 137 for minecraft 1.17.1 into customfile.jar
```

The tool automatically decides whether to save the jar to a file or print it to stdout depending on if its piped. (`if [ -t 1 ];`)

This allows you to automatically download the latest version of papermc like in the v1 of the api, but with the new v2 api.

## Installation:
```bash
# Link it to where the github repo is cloned
ln -s $(pwd)/papermc.bash ~/.local/bin/papermc
ln -s $(pwd)/papermc.bash /usr/local/bin/papermc

# Copy it to the folder
cp ./papermc.bash ~/.local/bin/papermc
cp ./papermc.bash /usr/local/bin/papermc
